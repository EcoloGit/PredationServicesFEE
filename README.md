# PredationServicesFEE
This is the repository for the paper "Predation services: quantifying societal effects of predators and their prey" ( https://doi.org/10.1002/fee.2336).
It includes a PDF of the published paper, along with the R code to reproduce the paper's findings.
You are welcome to use this code, although of course it would be great if you cited the paper. Also, I love knowing how others apply/use my ideas,
So feel free to drop me a line at sophiegilbert AT uidaho DOT edu. Thanks!
